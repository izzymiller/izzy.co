            If you're a Cisco IoT student looking for the answer to your
            question: “A comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big
            data management” is Hadoop, not cloud computing. You probably aren't
            interested in the rest of this post. Good luck studying!
          </aside>

          <p>
            Last week, I found a glitch in the matrix of SEO. For some reason,
            every month 2,400 people search for the exact string “a
            comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big data
            management”.
          </p>

          <img-caption>Data from SEMRush</img-caption>

          <p>
            And there are <strong>83 million</strong> Google search results for
            the query, “A comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for
            big data management”, 800 of which mention the phrase in complete
            form. Most of these 800 are very thin AI generated blogs just
            published in the last couple of months.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wtf? Of course, I stopped doing my SEO research (b o r i n g) and
            started trying to figure out
            <del>how to rank for this keyword</del> why the heck people were
            dogpiling into this weird aimless query.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog-heading">A strange game...</h2>
          <p>
            To understand this phenomenon, we need a bit of background on SEO.
            SEO is
            <span class="tooltip"
              >a strange game<span class="tooltiptext"
                >Almost as strange as global thermonuclear war</span
              ></span
            >. Here's how it goes:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>You run a business, and your business has a website.</li>
            <li>
              You want people to find your website when they search things on
              Google, and buy your stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
              There's an almost infinite number of keywords people are
              searching…
            </li>
            <li>
              But only some of those keywords are reasonable in topic for your
              business.
            </li>
            <li>
              And for those valuable keywords, there's only a couple places
              worth anything in the SERP (Search Engine Results Page). Even if
              your site is result #12 out of “About 82,800,000 results” for a
              hot keyword, you probably get nothing for your effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              So you keep writing new content until you get something in the top
              few spots.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            SEO is also a zero-sum game. The only way to get into those coveted
            top spots is to unseat an existing entry— someone just like you,
            with a business just like yours, who set off on the same mission as
            you, but simply didn't do a good enough job to keep your new
            incredible content from bumping them off. Their loss, your gain.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there is one way to outplay this competition a little bit: find
            a new keyword that nobody else is ranking for, but that people are
            searching for. Of course, you have to strike fast, and after a bit
            of time this will also turn into the zero-sum leapfrogging of any
            popular keyword. But you have a tiny bit of green field.
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            That's exactly what's happening here. There is a
            <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/iot/introduction-iot"
              >Cisco Introduction to IoT course</a
            >
            that must have gotten pretty popular recently. One of the potential
            questions on the final exam is about Hadoop, which, as we all know,
            is
            <strong
              >a comprehensive ecosystem of open source software for big data
              management</strong
            >.
          </p>

          <video controls muted loop autoplay class="iphone-vid" height="400px">
            <source src="https://i.imgur.com/t7nJ6Kl.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>

          <p>
            This means that thousands of people started searching for “a
            comprehensive ecosystem of open source software for big data
            management” every month as they studied for their final IoT exam.
            And the SEO analytics dashboards noticed.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was probably no content there at first, so it showed up on
            people's SEO dashboards just like it did on mine: as something data
            related, high volume, and low competition. Ripe for the plucking!
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog-heading" id="the-problem-with-seo">
            The problem with SEO
          </h2>
          <p>
            But there's a problem here that exposes the strange, mindless
            behavior of identifying a keyword in an SEO dashboard and pouncing
            on it without thinking twice.
          </p>
          <p>
            That 2 second GIF above actually contains 100% of the information
            the user searching needs. They just want to know the answer to their
            Jeopardy-style question, and nothing more. One word, “Hadoop”, does
            the trick.
          </p>
          <p>
            And Google knows this, so it adds a “Question and Answers” block
            before the first SERP result, probably diverting a tremendous amount
            of traffic away from that page. Honors for that top page go to Ben
            Farrell at

          <p>
            The problem with that article is that in order to dominate the SEO
            rankings and please The Algorithm, it's metastasized from the
            one-word answer “Hadoop” into 1,066 words of jargon. The sentence
            about Hadoop doesn't even appear until word 491, almost halfway
            through the article.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this is <strong>BY FAR</strong> the best article in the entire
            SERP about the subject. All the rest appear to be either copy/pastes
            of Ben's article, AI generated garbage, or just outright scam links.
            Of the three results below, the top one is a site dedicated to
            copying &amp; pasting answers to Computer Based Tests (CBTs) in a
            freeform stream-of-consciousness blog that covers test subjects from
            apartheid history to printer network management. The other two
            escape me.

            My favorite result is from “HighAdviser.com”, which has one of the
            most powerful homepages I have ever seen. My favorite little detail
            here is that the date is actually wrong, somehow? It's July 14th as
            I write this, not 10th.

            Also, I mean, "Innovation Management Generate Fresh Ideas"? “Boys

            quit my job and write for High Adviser full time. I think I could

            There's even a 4chan /b/ post in the SERP, obviously with an NSFW
            image attached to it. The irony is that this is genuinely the most
            helpful item on the entire search page. This should be the #1
            result!

            I sort of doubt that this is driving meaningful traffic to these
            sites, but it's just fascinating to me to watch an SEO Meme like
            this develop, and see how fast the programmatic SEO hounds hurl
            themselves at a fresh target.

            This is only going to get worse with LLMs, at least in the interim
            before everyone stops using Google. There's now a ton of tools that
            automatically find low competition keywords and generate hundreds of
            AI blog posts for you in just a few minutes. Here's a guy claiming

            Some of these might work. But lots of them wont, and there'll be
            thousands of "glitch" keywords just like this one that get caught in
            a circular AI arms race of unhelpful SEO content. The real problem
            is just the lack of alignment these articles have with search
            intent—
            <strong
              >if you want people to land on your site and remember you
              favorably, you should just answer their question</strong
            >. Everything else is extraneous. I don't have high hopes for AI
            accurately determining the intent of all the strange keyword
            combinations out there, and so I expect we'll see more and more of
            these glitches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps only 4chan can save us with their reputation for kindness
            and straight to the point questions and answers.

            PS: secretly, I hope that this post starts ranking for “a
            comprehensive ecosystem of open source software for big data
            management”, which is why I have said it verbatim so many times and
            added a helpful callout at the top for students. To be honest, I'd
            settle for the 19th spot: just above highadviser.com.
