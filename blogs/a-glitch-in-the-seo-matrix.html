            If you're a Cisco IoT student looking for the answer to your
            question: “A comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big
            data management” is Hadoop, not cloud computing. You probably aren't
            interested in the rest of this post. Good luck studying!
          </aside> -->

          <p>
            Last week, I found a glitch in the matrix of SEO. For some reason,
            every month 2,400 people search for the exact string “a
            comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big data
            management”.
          </p>

          <img width="50%" src="https://i.imgur.com/d91BDzY.png" />
          <br />
          <img-caption>Data from SEMRush</img-caption>

          <p>
            And weirdly, there are ~1,000 results for the exact query “A
            comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big data
            management”. This is at once a weirdly small and weirdly large
            number— small because most Google searches have tens of millions of
            results, but large because most Google searches for exact string
            matches of that length actually turn up few, or no results. So
            there's something to this phrase.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking at the results, it's immediately obvious that most of these
            are very thin AI generated blogs just published in the last couple
            of months.
          </p>

          <p>
            Wtf? Of course, I stopped doing my SEO research (b o r i n g) and
            started trying to figure out
            <del>how to rank for this keyword</del> why the heck people were
            dogpiling into this weird query.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog-heading">A strange game...</h2>
          <p>
            And I figured it out! But to fully understand this phenomenon, we
            need a bit of background on SEO.
          </p>
          <p>
            SEO is
            <span class="tooltip"
              >a strange game<span class="tooltiptext"
                >Almost as strange as global thermonuclear war</span
              ></span
            >. Here's how it goes:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>You run a business, and your business has a website.</li>
            <li>
              You want people to find your website when they search things on
              Google, so they buy your stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
              There's an almost infinite number of keywords people are
              searching…
            </li>
            <li>
              But only some of those keywords are reasonable in topic for your
              business.
            </li>
            <li>
              And for those valuable keywords, there's only a couple places
              worth anything in the SERP (Search Engine Results Page). Even if
              your site is result #12 out of “About 82,800,000 results” for a
              hot keyword, you probably get nothing for your effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              So you keep trying new content until you get something in the top
              few spots.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            SEO is also a zero-sum game. The only way to get into those coveted
            top spots is to unseat an existing entry— someone just like you,
            with a business just like yours, who set off on the same mission as
            you, but simply didn't do a good enough job to keep your new
            incredible content from bumping them off. Their loss, your gain.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there is one way to outplay this competition a little bit: find
            a new keyword that nobody else is ranking for, but that people are
            searching for. Of course, you have to strike fast, and after a bit
            of time this will also turn into the zero-sum leapfrogging of any
            popular keyword. But you have a tiny bit of green field.
          </p>

            A comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big data
            management
          </h2>
          <p>
            That's exactly what's happening here! There is a
            <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/iot/introduction-iot"
              >Cisco Introduction to IoT course</a
            >
            that must have gotten pretty popular recently. One of the potential
            questions on
            <a
              href="https://priyadogra.com/cisco-introduction-to-iot-final-exam-answers/"
              >a sample final exam</a
            >
            is about Hadoop, which, as we all know, is
            <strong>
              a comprehensive ecosystem of open source software for big data
              management
            </strong>
            !
          </p>

          <video controls muted loop autoplay class="iphone-vid" height="400px">
            <source src="https://i.imgur.com/t7nJ6Kl.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>

          <p>
            This means that thousands of students started searching for “a
            comprehensive ecosystem of open source software for big data
            management” every month as they studied for their final IoT exam.
            And the SEO analytics dashboards noticed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The really interesting thing about this case is that the original
            source content driving this search interest is
            <strong>not</strong> publicly available or indexed. This query is
            copied and pasted verbatim from an exam, which are famously not
            something you want to be found on Google.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of the time when something new emerges that's worth searching
            for, there's some party that's already front-run the SEO game. New
            Apple Vision Pro? Been talked about for months, plus Apple's got a
            page for it. OpenAI Code Interpreter? There's already 8 million
            results.
          </p>

          <img width="60%" src="https://i.imgur.com/dRh0s5l.png" />

          <p>
            But here, there was a rare SEO vacuum: a very specific high volume
            query, with almost zero content to match. The SEO dashboard tools
            see that, think "JACKPOT!", and that's why we have a thousand
            low-quality posts desperately trying to rank for this strange and
            confusingly specific keyword. Mystery solved.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog-heading" id="the-problem-with-seo">
            The problem with SEO
          </h2>
          <p>
            But there's a problem here that exposes the strange, mindless
            behavior of finding a keyword in an SEO dashboard and pouncing on it
            without thinking twice.
          </p>
          <p>
            That 2 second Quizlet GIF above actually contains 100% of the
            information the user searching needs. They just want to know the
            answer to their Jeopardy-style question, and nothing more. One word,
            “Hadoop”, does the trick.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google knows this, so it adds a “Question and Answers” block before
            the first SERP result, probably diverting a tremendous amount of
            traffic away from that page. Honors for that top page go to Ben
            Farrell at
            <a

          <p>
            But since that article was written purely to dominate the SEO
            rankings and please The Algorithm, it's metastasized from the
            one-word answer “Hadoop” into 1,066 words of jargon. The sentence
            about Hadoop doesn't even appear until word 491, almost halfway
            through the article.
            <strong
              >It wasn't written to answer someone's question or satisfy their
              search intent. It was just written to rank.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            And this is <strong>BY FAR</strong> the best article in the entire
            SERP about the subject. All the rest appear to be either copy/pastes
            of Ben's article, AI generated garbage, or just outright scam links.
            Of the three results below, the top one is a site dedicated to
            copying &amp; pasting answers to Computer Based Tests (CBTs) in a
            freeform stream-of-consciousness blog that covers test subjects from
            apartheid history to printer network management. The other two
            escape me.
          </p>

          <p>
            My favorite result is from “HighAdviser.com”, which has one of the
            most powerful homepages I have ever seen. My favorite little detail
            here is that the date is actually wrong, somehow? It's July 14th as
            I write this, not 10th.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, I mean, "Innovation Management Generate Fresh Ideas"? “Boys
            And A Dog Homemaking Homeschool Tips—
            <strong>For Busy Folks</strong>? No notes. I desperately want to
            quit my job and write for High Adviser full time. I think I could

            There's even a 4chan /b/ post in the SERP, obviously with an NSFW
            image attached to it. The irony is that this is genuinely the most
            helpful item on the entire search page. This should be the #1
            result!

            I sort of doubt that this is driving meaningful traffic to these
            sites, but it's fascinating to me to watch an SEO Meme like this
            develop, and see how fast the programmatic SEO hounds hurl
            themselves at a fresh target.

            This is only going to get weirder with LLMs, at least in the interim
            before everyone stops using Google. There's now a ton of tools that
            automatically find low competition keywords and generate hundreds of
            AI blog posts for you in just a few minutes. Here's a guy claiming

            Some of these might be helpful! But lots of them wont, and there'll
            be thousands of "glitch" keywords just like this one that get caught
            in a circular AI arms race of unhelpful SEO content. The real
            problem is just the lack of alignment these articles have with
            search intent—
            <strong
              >if you want people to land on your site and remember you
              favorably, you should just answer their question</strong
            >. Everything else is extraneous. I don't have high hopes for AI
            accurately determining the intent of all the strange keyword
            combinations out there, and so I expect we'll see more and more of
            these glitches.

            PS: secretly, I hope that this post starts ranking for “a
            comprehensive ecosystem of open source software for big data
            management”, which is why I have said it verbatim so many times and
            added a helpful callout at the top for students. To be honest, I'd
            settle for the 19th spot: just above highadviser.com.
